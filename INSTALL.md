# INSTALLATION

```console
$ composer require zendframework/zendframework
```

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Zend Framework 2 requires PHP 5.5 or later.

## GETTING STARTED

A great place to get up-to-speed quickly is the Zend Framework
QuickStart:

http://framework.zend.com/manual/current/en/user-guide/overview.html

The QuickStart covers some of the most commonly used components of ZF.
Since Zend Framework is designed with a use-at-will architecture and
components are loosely coupled, you can select and use only those
components that are needed for your project.
