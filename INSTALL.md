# INSTALLATION

```console
$ composer require zendframework/zendframework
```

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Zend Framework 2 requires PHP 5.5 or later.

## DEVELOPMENT VERSIONS

If you would like to preview enhancements or bug fixes that have not yet
been released, you can obtain the current development version of Zend
Framework using one of the following methods:

 -  Using a Git client. Zend Framework is open source software, and the
    Git repository used for its development is publicly available.
    Consider using Git to get Zend Framework if you already use Git for
    your application development, want to contribute back to the
    framework, or need to upgrade your framework version very often.

 -  Checking out a working copy is necessary if you would like to directly
    contribute to Zend Framework; a working copy can be updated any time
    using git pull.

To clone the git repository, use the following URL:

https://github.com/zendframework/zf2.git

For more information about Git, please see the official website:

## GETTING STARTED

A great place to get up-to-speed quickly is the Zend Framework
QuickStart:

http://framework.zend.com/manual/current/en/user-guide/overview.html

The QuickStart covers some of the most commonly used components of ZF.
Since Zend Framework is designed with a use-at-will architecture and
components are loosely coupled, you can select and use only those
components that are needed for your project.
